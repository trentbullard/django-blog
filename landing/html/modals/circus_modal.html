  A true Windows service written in C#.NET for a former employer. This application polled the CAISO ADS (5-minute dispatch) API in order to calculate and send real-time ramping setpoints to power generators.
  The data retrieved by my application was used to ensure that each CAISO Market client generator was operating at the appropriate output at any given time. All data subject to NERC CIP regulations.
